This website is using [Google Analytics](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/terms/us/) to analyze page visiting data (I'm something of a data scientist myself). It collects some anonymized information including, but not limited to your country, language, device and browser. It respects `do not track` setting.
### Why
Because each user in Google Analytics will warm my heart. There's really great to know that some  Android user from India was interested in my blog posts. If you're that user and reading it now, you can always block cookies on this website in your browser settings.
